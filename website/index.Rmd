**Problem 2**

This problem was using the dataset NY NOAA. I explored the change of precipitation (mm), snowfall (mm), and temperature  (degrees C) in Year 2008.

If you would like to see the plots for problem 2, please click [here](problem2.html)

Chart A is a 3-D chart showing the precipitation in tear 2008. Summer (Jul to Sep) had a larger precipitation than other months. One interesting thing was that there was no precipitation in Jun 2008.

Chart B is a bar chart showing the sum of snowfall by month in year 2008. From the chart, we found that there were 7 months having snowfall in year 2008 from Oct to April. And the largest snowfall was in December.

Chart C is a line chart showing the average maximum temperature and average minimum temperature by month in year 2008. From the chart, we found that the trend of the min and max temperature were the same and the range of the temperature by month was around 12 degrees C. February had the lowest mean temperature and July had the highest mean temperature.
