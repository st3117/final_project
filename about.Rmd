###Introduction

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among American women. It is estimated that about 1 in 8 U.S women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of lifetime. An inverse association between smoking and breast cancer survival rate has been reported by many studies. A history of cigarette smoking can significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. However, there is a limited number of prior literatures investigate the association of smoking and breast cancer at a population level using national survey data. To address this knowledge gap, we conduct this secondary data analysis study on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from year 2011 to 2016 to see if there is a trend of smoking and breast cancer risk across years in the United States. 

The key predictor of interest was established using the question on “have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life”. The outcome of this study used the question “what kind of cancer was it”. Other covariates include race, age, alcohol, overweight, income, and age at the first birth were identified based on literature review from Pubmed. 

###Data

**Source**
We used the Demographics and Questionnaire data files from the NHANES 2011-2016 datasets (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Default.aspx). NHANES is a nationally representative, multi-stage complex survey designed to assess the health and nutritional status of the non-institutionalized, civilian US population.
